                               it was febaury 2022 when we decided tha we would take a  trip down to london after being left at andover train staion, where we tried to call the guard to get us on the train but completely engored us, so we spoke to the guard on the next train, who offered us 2 free return tickets to anywhere on the SWR network. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                            when it was the day of our trip to london we decided, we would visit the london sealife aquarium, but unfortunately, it was fully booked for the day and were no tickets avalible on the day. Instead we went into the Shrek adventures attraction as my mum wanted to go in last time but never got the chance, luckly they had some tickets left at the time we wanted. 
                            </p>  
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                            So as we went in, we enter a magical lift which took us up a floor had the chance for a toilet break (inside the toilets they had speakers wwhich said stuff like "ewww you've washed your hands" in shrek's voice) and then got our photo taken while we are  waiting to go in the main attraction, after waiting, we were in this big room where one of the staff at the attraction explained through some legal/ health and saftey proticols, so if anything bad was to happen then we would know what to do before entering the main attraction bus ride.      
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                                so the bus takes you on a magical bus jurney from london to the far far away land which was driven by donkey however we accidently stood of rumple stiltskins fravourite wicked whitch, we make us in a lot of trouble, so we were task to find 3 ingredients to make a potion that would take us home (back to london), however we had to do it quickly before rumple stiltskins got his hand on us. after going through different parts of the attraction we all worked as a team to get the ingredients to give the baker who used his cauldron to blend them altogether. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                                after blending together an portal opened up and we were asked to say some magic words to keep the portal open, however, rumple stiltskins had sabotaged the portal, so intead of being transported back to london/home we were transported to a old jail where we were traped. luckly we had the help of shrek to help us get set free and we finaly made it back to london/ home safely.
                                it was really fun and would definitely recomend it to anyone who is thinking of going.  
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                                after we finished in the attraction and the giftshop/ receving our photos we decided we would go shopping at westfeld (sheperd bush)
                                shopping center. 
                                was going to go by the underground but was appalled to find out that not all stations on the london underground are wheelchair accessable/ have lift access to get down to the platform. so we had tro go by bus instead, i followed the TFL staff members directions wrong so we went in a complete circle.   
                            </p>
